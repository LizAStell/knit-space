When Morrie’s Bar opened in 1969, members of the Student Homophile League decided to tell their gay friends to go, to make Morrie’s a de facto gay bar. The owner, Morris Angell, tolerated the students until October 1970, when he refused to serve people he thought were gay. The Gay Liberation Front began a months-long boycott of the bar, organizing sit-ins and asking people to join their protest. 

In March 1971, Angell agreed to stop discriminating against his gay patrons, and Morrie’s continued to be known a gay bar until it closed.
