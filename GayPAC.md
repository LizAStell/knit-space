Gay People at Cornell (GayPAC) saw as much of the political and social changes on campus as Cornellâ€™s Gay Liberation Front (GLF). GayPAC united students to rally for more courses on sexuality and a program house for queer students. More support groups for queer students were created while GayPAC existed, such as the queer Jewish and Christian groups, and the Gays, Bisexuals, and Lesbians of Color (GBLOC).
