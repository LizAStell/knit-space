A 1986 letter to the editor in The Cornell Daily Sun asked presdient Frank Rhodes why there were no courses on homosexuality or a department dedicated to the study of sexuality. Finally, Lesbian, Bisexual Gay Studies (LBG) was offered as part of the Womenâ€™s Studies program in 1992. LBG Studies offered a minor for both graduate and undergraduate students, then an undergraduate major. In 2009, it became Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies to reflect scholarship on a broad range of studies on gender and sexuality.
