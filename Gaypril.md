“Gay May” of the 1970s and 80s became Gaypril in the 90s to better fit with the academic calendar and allow a whole month for festivites. When Cornell recognized April as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Awareness month in 1986, queer student groups expanded on the May Gay traditions with more invited speakers, workshops concerts, and an annual film series with Cornell Cinema. GBLOC’s conference for students of color was introduced as part of Gaypril, creating a month of inclusive queer activites and fun.
